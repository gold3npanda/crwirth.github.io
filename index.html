        <h1>A brief Introduction</h1>

          <p>I have always had an interest in and passion for technology. It was my junior year in high school that I got my first exposure to life at a network hardware startup experimenting with long-range Wi-Fi especially in the 2.4 GHz band.</p>

          <p>From there I went on to study East Asian religions in college but found as much as I loved the material, it left more questions than answers. From there I started exploring computer science classes and loved that it challenged me in a way that I never had been before, as well as the fact that it left you with more results than questions.</p>

          <p>After my undergraduate studies, I began working in the tech industry for a local eCommerce startup, and other companies based in Silicon Valley.</p>

        <h2>What I have been up to lately</h2>

        <p>After leaving my job during the pandemic, amidst finishing my masters and a software engineering bootcamp, I sat down and thought about what I was interested in and how I could make an impact in my local community. After a lot of research, I ended up creating a local meetup to aide in the development of the Ethereum ecosystem where I give and host technical talks on system architecture, the open-source community, crypto art, smart contract development, and much, much more. </p>

        <p>You can find a link to our growing meetup here: <a>https://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ethereum/</a> </p>

        <p>I have found being involved with the local technical community and growing a niche of my own has been very satisfying, and I have loved meeting all of the new people that I have through the process. All of this work is not achieved without the help of others who have done it before I, so to those who gave me solid advice on the process, thank you.</p>

        <p>I just recently started a new job as an engineer with a wonderful remote team of digital nomads. I work *crazy* hours with people based all over the world to come together and make shit happen. I love the work, I am constantly learning, and I am very grateful for my job with the team at DAB.</p>

        <h2>A Work In Progress</h2>

        <p>I will continue to update this page with more content as time goes on.</p>
